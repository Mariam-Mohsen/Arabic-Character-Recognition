# Arabic-Character-Recognition
 A machine learning project that explores two classification approaches using a structured dataset. The main objectives of the project are data exploration, preparation, and evaluating the performance of two different models: Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks.

First Experiment: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Training and tuning an SVM model, followed by performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

Second Experiment: Neural Networks
Implementation and training of a simple feedforward neural network using Keras/TensorFlow, with comparisons to the SVM results.
